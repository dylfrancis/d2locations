            <h2>The Tower</h2>
            <p>The Tower is a social space located atop the defensive wall encircling the Last City. It serves as the
                headquarters of the Vanguard and the home of the Guardians.<br><br>Following the defeat of Dominus Ghaul
                and his Red Legion, the Vanguard opened facilities on wall's ramparts while the original Tower, which
                was destroyed at the onset of the Red War, was being rebuilt. The new Tower provides a dramatic view of
                the reawakened Traveler.</p>

                            Guardians. He can also sell legendary weapons that arrive on Armsday, if the player has

                            military operations, and led the Guardians to victory in both the Taken War and Red War. In
                            the aftermath of both conflicts, Zavala has become increasingly isolated and reluctant to
                            commit Guardians to conflicts outside of the Last City.</td>
